### 2. Distance Calculations
Write function(s) in R to calculate the naive Euclidean, chordal, and geodesic distance between two points. Then calculate the distance between Bozeman (45.6770° N, 111.0429° W) and Billings, MT (45.7833° N, 108.5007° W); Bellingham, WA(48.7519° N, 122.4787° W) ; Burlington, VT (44.4759° N, 73.2121° W); and Blacksburg, VA (37.2284° N, 80.4234° W).
